				<h1>WMF HAS WOKEN!!!</h1>
				<p>Since last year WrestleMania, WMF has been inactive for over a year. Last year, after WrestleMania, due to the loss of the famous Undertaker, many WMF members left the group including admins. Most of the admins that are still in the group are so busy that they can't handle the group. Now, we have rumors that Undertaker is returning for one last time. Therefore, most of us are tuning in. This makes the former admin Michael Zaw Ye Horan returns to the group and admins allowed 3k+ members to come in. Now, WMF is WOKEN AGAIN. THE GROUP IS ACTIVE. </p>
